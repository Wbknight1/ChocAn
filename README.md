## Features

- **Member Portal**: Request health services, view service history
- **Provider Portal**: Approve service requests, bill ChocAn, view provider directory, generate reports
- **Manager Portal**: Generate summary/member/provider reports, view all users, add members/providers, generate EFT data
- **Operator Portal**: Full CRUD operations for members and providers, suspend/unsuspend members

## Prerequisites

- Java JDK 11 or higher
- GSON library (included in `lib/gson-2.10.1.jar`)

## **NOTE**: Refer to the `BUILD.md` documentation for further instructions on running/building ChocAn on different systems

## Building

Compile all source files:

```bash
javac -cp lib/gson-2.10.1.jar -d bin src/chocan/*.java
```

## Running

### Linux/macOS
```bash
java -cp bin:lib/gson-2.10.1.jar chocan.Main
```

### Windows
```cmd
java -cp "bin;lib\gson-2.10.1.jar" chocan.Main
```

### WSL Users
If running in WSL, you need an X11 display server. On Windows 11 with WSLg:
```bash
export DISPLAY=:0
java -cp bin:lib/gson-2.10.1.jar chocan.Main
```

# AI DISCLOSURE:
Artifical Intelligence was utilized to complete portions of this application. The AI service used was Cursor IDE, and it was used in contexts such as building test cases, refactoring, commenting, documentation, syntax errors and suggestions, logic errors, environment errors, and prototyping.

The following is a reference for all known cases of AI-edited or generated source code. 

**Note**: Documentation is more commonly generated by AI in this codebase, for thoroughness and efficiency sake. 


### AI References:

**ACMEAccountingServices.java**
| Line/Snippet | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Lines 119-120` | Assigning a map of a string and double and a map of a string and serivce record list with the type of a HashMap |
| `Lines 126-136` | Assigning fee with the service fee, or catching it upon exception. This code snipped was alo used in lines 163-167 and lines 172-176|

**DataCenter.java**
| Line/Snippet | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `getServiceRecordsForLastWeek()` | This method was partially generated by AI as i did not understand the Java time library |
| `Lines 341` | My AI Agent suggested that i use the ArrayList function to initialize the result variable, this is also on line 352 |

**Manager.java**
| Line/Snippet | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `new java.util.Scanner(System.in)` | AI generated the scanner object in line 37 initially and explained its use as an input stream reader |
| `Line 61` | jave.time.temporal.WeekFields.ISO` | Used for a standard definition of a week for the weekField |
| `Lines 129-136` | Created maps for a summary of consultations and total fees, and a map of provider number to the provider object for quick lookup |
| `try (java.util.Scanner scanner = new java.util.Scanner(System.in))` | The AI Agent suggested wrapping the scanner declaration in a try/catch resource so that it automatically closes when the block is out of scope |

**Member.java**
| Line/Snippet | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `None` | ... |

**membercard.java**
| Line/Snippet | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `None` | ... |

**MemberServiceReport.java**
| Line/Snippet | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Line 147` | Collections, Comparator, and @Override were suggestions by my agent after I had an override error for this datetime sorter override |

**Operator.java**
| Line/Snippet | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `None` | ...| 


**Person.java**
| Line/Snippet | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `None` | ... |

**Provider.java**
| Line/Snippet | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `none` | ... |

**ProviderDirectory.java**
| Line/Snippet | Description |
|-------|-------------|
|  `Line 17` | AI Agent assisten in generating service codes |
| `Line 22` | Helped to format and write out to the file after the sort in displayProviderDirectory() |
| `lines 33-36` | wrote boilerplate code for writing to an external file |

**readAndWritable.java**
| Line/Snippet | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Lines 139-` | The Private Static Class Local Date Adapter extends type adapter and overrides read and write to JSON for the date, which is not native to GSON. I used this because the date would not output and I prompted Cursor to assist with that |


**Terminal.md**:
- As disclosed, Wheeler K. generated a portion of the terminal code as a prototype through Cursor agent and merged successful integrations with the main codebase.
- Logan Hernandez wrote the majority of the foundation of the class manually.
